1. Have 2 ISO's as input, extract to same folders (using command line 7ZIP), overwriting data
2. Use Utena.exe to extract both ISO's to "Converted" folder
3. Convert all the audio from the extracted ISO's to "Converted" folder
4. Parse options, writing each "day" to a JSON file, and having a text file with new lines seperating the days, in order.
Some options WILL need to manually Parse
Options are NOT names, sprites are reused. Generate a unique option name, i.e. Option1 for each option seperating5. 
5. Investigate movie conversion
6. Ignore upscaling for now. Focus on getting a few scenes working as a proof of concept.
7. Go through the game and start grouping sequences together into one "scene", and name each scene
