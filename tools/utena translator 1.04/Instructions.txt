To translate the Japanese isos, follow these steps:

- Place the Japanese isos of the game in this directory. They should be named "Utena_Sega1.iso" and "Utena_Sega2.iso"

- (Optional but recommended step)
Right click on "translate.bat" and select "Edit". Near the beginning, you will find these two lines:

set name=default
set surname=default

Change "default" in both lines, with the desired name and surname for your character, respectively, and save the file.

This step is optional, if you don't do this step, your character will have the name you enter in game, which is 
very limited (only 3 chars for name and surname).

The name and surname you enter here don't have any length limit but you must use only valid English characters, don't use tildes or 
special symbols from other languages. 
Japanese characters can also be used, but in that case, the .bat file must be edited in UTF-8 mode.

- Run (double-click) translate.bat.

That's all. Now you will have two new files in this directory: "Utena_English1.iso" and "Utena_English2.iso", which are the ones
you must use with the emulator. The original Japanese isos remain untouched by the program. 
Please keep your Japanese isos, you will need them for updates of the translation or to change the name of character.

If you changed the name of your character in the .bat file, you can change it again at any moment by editing and running the .bat again.

Setting up the emulator and running the game (you can skip this if you already know how to do it)

- Download the emulator from internet. The recommended emulator is "SSF 0.12 beta R3".
  There is a more updated version of the emulator, "SSF 0.12 beta R4", but on my tests, it can be problematic
  with some NVIDIA cards or drivers (not in all of them). 
  
  The game can also work on the other main Saturn emulator: Yabause, but unfortunately sound will not work on it; it is only
  recommended if you can't make SSF work in your system.
  
- Because SSF can't load ISO files, you will need a Virtual CD emulator. There are a lot of them, but not all of them are compatible with SSF.
  The recommended one is "Virtual CloneDrive", which is free and compatible with SSF.
  
- Saturn BIOS: good news, you don't need any bios file for SSF. The internal one of SSF works pretty well with this game. 
  You will need one if you use Yabause emulator, though.

- Mount "Utena_English1.iso" with Virtual CloneDrive.

- Run SSF. In Options->CD Drive, select the unit of CloneDrive (ELBY CLONEDRIVE or something like that).

- Optionally set the keys for the Saturn buttons (you can use keyboard or controller).

- Now you can run the game. Use Alt+Enter to put the game in full screen, and Alt+Enter again to leave full screen mode.

- When you create a new game, you will be asked to enter a name for your character.
  If you did the optional step of setting the name of your character in the .bat file, then this one will be ignored in the game, but
  it must be filled anyway.
  
  The name here will still appear in the load/save screen though, so maybe you want to make a short version of the name (otherwise just select letters randomly).
  To enter western characters, go to the top-right Japanese letter, which will open a box with the western letters.
  
- Enjoy the game! At some point of the game, you will be asked to change the disc, just follow the instructions in screen.
