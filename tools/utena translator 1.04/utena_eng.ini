; Last updated 10/8/2015
; Version 1.03: Dallbun fixed reference to Utena as female in the "Do you have a girlfriend" choice, and other errors provided by Aerialrave.
; Version 1.02: Endless re-fixed things that Dallbun broke by editing an older version of the script.
; Version 1.01: Dallbun fixed a couple typos and fiddled with a couple other translations.
; Version 1.00: initial release
;
; Some notes about this file works.
; The file is split into sections, each one corresponds to a DAY_XX.SCN file of the game.
; There is also a "General" section right below these comments, with general settings or strings that affect the whole.
;
; At the left part, there is a variable name, or search term for the translator. You don't need to touch that.
; (it is actually an audio file name for normal texts, and a special search term for the translator for options, 
;  but you don't need to care about that.)
;
; At the right part, you have the string with the text. Strings go enclosed by "".
; You could actually have them enclosed by '' or not enclosed at all, but those have their own problems, so just stick to enclose them with "".
; If you need to include a " symbol inside a string enclosed by "", use \"
; E.g: "There wasn't anything like a \"classical music cafe\" in my home town" ->(becomes) There wasn't anything like a "classical music cafe" in my home town
; To introduce a newline, use \n
; Technical notes about "\n": translator doesn't translate this to the typical newline char (ASCII code 10), but to the char with ASCII code 14, 
; which is what the game uses.
;
; There are also these boolean variable names you'll see at the beginning of each section.
; You don't need to worry about them, and instead leave them like they are currently.
; Anyway here is a explanation of each one of each variables. You should read at least the part about the "user_linking = true"
;
; fix_duplicate_names = true -> this tells the translator to link together some items that have both same exact text and same exact audio file
; This option is only meaningful for DAY_B1, DAY_B2, DAY_C0, DAY_C1, DAY_C2, DAY_C3, DAY_D1, DAY_D3, DAY_D4, DAY_D5 and DAY_D6.
; Just leave them like they are, at "true". If you remove them, or you set it to false, there will be text that can't be translated at those files.
;
;
; user_linking = true  
; This enables the assigning of the text of a variable to the text of a previous variable. Very useful due to amount of repetitive texts.
; E.g:
; VA03A018 = "Himemiya, are you okay?"
; VA03B012 = VA03A018
;
; Now VA03A018 and VA03B012 have both the same text: "Himemiya, are you okay?"
; However be ware of not doing things like this:
;
; VD69A017 = "Chigusa-san... I'm sorry!"
; VD69B017 = VD69A017
; VD69C017 = VD69B017 
;
; VD69A017 and VD69B017 would get assigned the same text ("Chigusa..."), but VD69C017 would get assigned the text "VD69B017" 
; The translator would give you a warning, but it would proceed anyway.
; The proper way of doing that would be:
;
; VD69A017 = "Chigusa-san... I'm sorry!"
; VD69B017 = VD69A017
; VD69C017 = VD69A017
;
; Now all those items have same text.
; By default, I enabled "user_linking" in all the sections of this file.
; Note that you can NOT assign a variable to the one of another section!!
;
; I went to the trouble of doing most of the variables assignments of similar Japanese texts, so you probably don't need to do more.
; I mainly excluded small expressions like "Hai", "Un", etc since those may translate differently in several situations.
;
; But if while doing the translation, you found out that a text that is same in Japanese shouldn't be the same in English (or the language you translate to),
; (like for example some gender or singular/plural thing), just undo the variable assignment and put your text.
;
; Note: user linking only work for normal texts, not for options.
;
;
; machine_linking = true 
;
; This causes the translator to search for similar texts items, and link them together (in order to save bytes)
; This option is NOT recommended to be used along with "user_linking = true"
; the reason is that if a "machine links" happen before an "user link", you may end with variables that can't be linked to other (translator would warn anyway)
; Items that are linked with this option will appear on translator output.
;
; By default, I only enabled machine_linking = true on "DAY_C0" since size is only a concern on that file.
; user_linking is also enabled there, but it shouldn't be an issue.
;
;
; rewrite_all_va = true
; This makes the translator to write to the SCN file in a different way.
; Used along with one or more of the three other above (fix_duplicate_names, user_linking, machine_linking), 
; it happens to cause an optimization of size that is TOTALLY needed in DAY_C0.
; The reason is that SCN files can only be 65535 bytes, and DAY_C0.SCN was getting dangerously close to the limit 
; (and English text takes more bytes than Japanese in SJIS)
;
; There is no need at all for you to set this on any other section.
;
;
; ****************************
; Some other notes:
; While translating and using an emulator, DON'T use emulator save states.
; If you save game state, leave, translate a few things more, and load game state, you can get unexpected results.
; The reason is that game states have the state of the machine saved, including RAM. Which may include the cache of structure
; or the headers of SCN files, and if the SCN file changed in between, unpredictable things can happen (crash, invalid text, unexpected scene jumps, text not updated with latest translation, etc)
;
; Stick to use normal save points when doing the translation. Those are totally fine.
;
;
;
; Dallbun: TRANSLATION NOTES
; This entire section are translation notes left by Dallbun. Other than this set, unmarked notes were made by Endless. Notes by me are prefaced with "Dallbun:" Mostly I put them there in case I wanted to check my own notes; they're probably not of interest to anybody else.
;
; Translators:
; Some of the text was originally translated by me, and some by Ayu Ohseki. Endless consolidated the two, then I went back to fill gaps, fix trouble spots, check accuracy, and so on.
; In general, it seems to me that Ayu's translations are more liberal and "localized," and mine are plainer and more conservative.
; I'm not the one who originally put our two incomplete translations together, and I didn't compare them line-by-line, but I did skim over her translation and used her versions in some places where I thought she just flat-out did a better job.
;
; Stylistic choices:
; Honorifics have been kept intact, in almost all cases. Utena fans are pretty honorific-savvy and sensitive to them, since they become a big deal by the end of episode 1. Exceptions have been made for things like Chigusa's "Snow White-chan," which sounds weird.
; Names are last name, first name. Probably lazy, but the game is voice-acted - when you can hear Saionji say "Tenjou Utena" while the text says "Utena Tenjou," it feels weird to me. Could easily be changed.
; "the Ends of the World" has been used over "End of the World," because the latter sounds apocalyptic in English, while the former sounds more liminal.
; Duelist, Student Council, Rose Seal, Dueling Game, and Dueling Arena are always capitalized. Duel, and the verb "to duel," are not.
; "Senpai" over "senpai," because we are not using Traditional Hepburn romanization.
; "Juri" over "Jury," because it's not intended to be a foreign name.
;
; References to other stuff in the Japanese:
; The names of the stores "Magnolia" and "Lilac" are references to the titles of Chiho Saito manga. The kanji used are not common.
;
; Credits:
; Ayu Ohseki included contact information and credits in her translated script, so I thought I would repeat them here. Credit where credit is due!
